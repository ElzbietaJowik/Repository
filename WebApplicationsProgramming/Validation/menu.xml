<!-- Maybe it is a little hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything.
    XML is just information wrapped in tags.
    There must be written a piece of software to send, receive, store, or display it
    
    XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
    HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
    XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are

    Syntax:
        <root>
        <child>
            <subchild>.....</subchild>
        </child>
        </root> 
    Only one root element in the document can be accepted.
